[Verse 1]
Like summer nights passing by, passing by
Blow away moments I regret
Like the wind you came passing by, passing by
Stir up an endless storm

[Verse 2]
Like winter nights passing by, passing by
Under my blankets, I chase after you
Like the wind you came passing by, passing by
Ghosts you have left behind

[Verse 3]
Every meter of my skin reaching out
Like every other ghost here to prove my love
Every meter of my skin, mmm
Like every other ghost, refusing to be dead

[Outro]
La-la-la-la
La-la, la-la
