[Realm of Light]
Ooh
It's this time of the year
A very so merry night we hold dear
So many, so many regrets bring me to tears
Not many, not many notice nor care

Oh, oh, oh,
My savior
Oh, oh, oh
Why does a common fire hold so much power?

If only we could be forever na√Øve and pure
If only we could lead painless futures
If only there could be a forgiving world

[Realm of Darkness]
Maybe that was when
I chose to stay fallen

Lights
A star
A voice
A twisted thought

A touch
A kiss
A distorted dream

Ripples (ripples)
A well (a well)
A stone (a stone)
A multiplying desire (desire)
A fruit (a fruit)
A sin (a sin)
A holy mother

I'm infected, I'm infected
You have invaded and re-created me

Stepped over my body
Found a sunny spot
Curled into a ball
Spinning out the silk
From my head to toe

Inside the warm cocoon, I dreamt to be like you
Though I know there's no undo
What do I have left to lose?

Split
A sky
An earth
I fell into a crack (a crack)

A birth (a birth)
An egg (an egg)
A freshly opened membrane
A cell
A rot
A face returned to ashes
A wound
An art
A sentient canvas

Breaking, breaking, breaking the shell
Breaking out, oh break it now
Show me how, show me how
Listen up, my broken child
Let's lament, let's lament
The life, the death, the good, the bad
The never ending curse we cast

Control, control, control, release
Control, betray, control, let go
Conceal, reveal, unreal, surreal
Invoke, evoke, decode, reload
Let's lament, let's lament
The past that only got to live in the incomplete holy land

Celestial (ayiah)
We're astral (ayiou)
I'm reborn (le rheaiah)
Total liberation (katre o lamenta)
My tender skin
A vagitus song (essential)

I breathed (eventual)
And screamed (eternal)
From my new lungs (inevitable freeing of the soul)
