[Verse 1]
I will be the best astronaut
The best of the best, I kid you not
Her eyes sparkled like the galaxy has died her pupils
As she held my hand

[Chorus]
We dig through the dump looking for treasures unfound
As you softly sing the sweetest delightful song
We've built a titanium space shuttle out of hope
So one day the world can be saved by this sound

[Verse 2]
Lu-da-da, da-du-da-di-da
We'll name it Excαlibur and send it to the sky
It crashed to the rim of the world and fell apart

[Verse 3]
Hey, don't you worry
Your dreams, I'll make them come true
Sticks and stones won't break our bones
As long as you have me

[Chorus]
We dig through the dump looking for treasures unfound
As you softly sing the sweetest delightful song
We've built a titanium cyborg out of me
So one day the world can be saved by you
My bones are titanium but my heart is made of stars
So ride on my shoulders, I'm your Excαlibur
