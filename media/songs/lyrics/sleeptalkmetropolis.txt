[Verse 1]
Metro
Suburbs
Commuters
Choo choo chah, choo choo chah
Crosswalk
Clock in
Excel sheets
Choo choo chah, choo choo chah
Meetings
Lunch break
Overtime
Choo choo chah, choo choo chah
Instant
Ramen
Rinse repeat, rinse repeat

[Interlude]
I'm building my muscles
I make my own bentos
Low waste and responsible
I'm learning to be minimal
I wish to be hired
To pay off my student loans
Enjoyed being alone
Don't want to be alone
I wanted my own home
I needed a new phone
I wanted to travel
The times are different, did you know, did you know?

[Chorus]
We're living in a dream, living in a dream
Spilling our time
On repeat, on repeat
Filling in the empty space beyond the yellow lines
We're living for the dream, living for the dream
Tiny mice looked right at me, right at me
Is it a sign?
That it's time to slow down
I am in a race of one

[Verse 2]
Sunday morning
Vacuum time
Choo choo chah, choo choo chah
Grocery shopping
Laundromat
Choo choo chah, choo choo chah
Pay bills
Emails
Second job
Choo choo chah, choo choo chah
One-pan
Spaghetti
Rinse repeat, rinse repeat

[Interlude]
Met you in the middle
Cause I got a flexible
Open-minded ego
Working to be sustainable
Wish you could be fired
So you could stop asking
Why are you still alone?
Don't want to be alone
I wanted time to date
I wanted a child someday
Tell me it's not too late
I'm doing my best in my days, in my days

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm dreaming of a sunny balcony
A cup of coffee
A buttered toast
A purring kitty
Living in a dream
I'm living a distant dream
I'm living for this dream
So don't you say yours was better

[Chorus]
Living in a dream, living in a dream
Spilling our time
On repeat, on repeat
Filling in the empty space beyond the yellow lines
We're living for the dream, living for the dream
Tiny mice looked right at me, right at me
Is it a sign?
That it's time to slow down
I am in a race of one
