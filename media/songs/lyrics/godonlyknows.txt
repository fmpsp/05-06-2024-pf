[Prologue: God]
Whenever you cry, just count your blessings
Every time you try learn something. Believe yourself
Look to the sky like a bird without wings
If you want to fly, feel your heart. Release yourself
We are alive in this world
Life is sometimes unfair
We keep going in this world
Lord will hear our prayers
Look up at the sky like a bird without wings
If you want to fly, feel your breeze. Release yourself
Why do you sigh? Just count your blessings
Every time you try, find something. Believe yourself
My mission is gonna be a tough one
I know it's not a game any more
I swear that I'll never fail again
'Cuz don't wanna regret any more
Can you hear I'm calling you?
I just wanna feel you
Don't forget to remember so please remember
I hear you are calling me
I want you to feel me
You know I won't surrender never surrender
My mission I've got to execute
I know it's not a game any more
I swear that I'll never fail again
'Cuz don't wanna be regret any more

[Chapter One: Vulcan]
Secrets of the Goddess God only knows
This is my fate, I accept all the pain
And overcome suffering
I share your fate, will never let you down
Do my best in everything
You are the light for me
I'll be the light for you
So just stay by your side
All the things will go your way
And go my way
That's just like a dream in the night
Here comes Luna
Always shining brightly
There's one definite truth, noble beauty
For the real love
Moving forward slightly
I carry out all my wishes
True justice, that's what I believe

[Chapter Two: Apollo]
I know that no one was to blame
Don't feel sorry, it was not your fault
Remember that you're in my thoughts
I hope you feel the same
You're the one who can save me
Every time I think of you
Feel like being with you
I'll be alright, cry no more
I smile for you, I sing for you
Every time you think of me
Please remember my song
I wait for you
And give me all of your love

{Chapter Three: Diana]
Whenever, whenever you need me
I'll come out right away and help you
Never be afraid
I should just achieve my aim
Whenever, whenever you need love
You should show your true emotion
Your sweet breath is
Just like a gentle breeze
You need someone to take your hand
Open your eyes and heart
Take your time
And tell me what is on your mind
Natural laws, everything grows
Want you to keep a pure mind
Love will make you much stronger
Natural laws, the river flows
Want you to stay innocent
And love will make you brighter
Natural laws, and the wind blows
Want you to find your love
Life will bring you a lot of happiness

[Chapter Four: Minerva]
You prefer sitting and spending your time
In the quiet room
And your favorite things are
Reading several books and day dreaming
I trust the wisdom of my soul
And keep the faith of my heart
Even if I stumble
I'll stand up and walk again
Move forward, take a chance
Here we go
Your positive thoughts and words
Will bring you luck
Don't hesitate to say and express your love
Let your heart be free now
You can change yourself

[Chapter Five: Mars]
My brave heart is a powerful weapon
To beat the evil and fight for the right
Like a beautiful woman dressed as a man
You're defending yourself against all your fears
You look comfortable disguising yourself
Must be satisfied with becoming somebody else
My brave heart is a powerful weapon
To beat the evil and fight for the right
Like a beautiful woman dressed as a man
You're defending yourself against all enemies
Gotta fight to win now

[Chapter Six: Mercury]
Run!
You're on the run
Tell me where you are headed
There is no rush, take your time
What is happening to you?
You're so in love
Through near or far, thinking of him
Imagine your future love
What's gonna happen to you?
It's fun to watch people
"Many men, many minds"
I'm curious about so many things
More and more
Don't be so sad if you lost your love
I know that you are much braver than you believe
And want you to stay the way you are
I wish you are always filled with happiness
